		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] supported the Yaoma tea industry as one of the many hands on a palace tea farm. Taking the instructions of the landowner, [PAWN_pronoun] watched the trees for disease between flushes, and gathered the freshest leaves during the harvests. The role attuned [PAWN_objective] to minute factors that could affect the shrub’s growth, granting [PAWN_objective] a bit of a green thumb.</baseDesc>
