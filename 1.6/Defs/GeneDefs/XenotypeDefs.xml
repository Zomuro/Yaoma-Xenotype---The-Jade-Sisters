		<description>Designed to integrate with humanity, the yaoma are a hermaphroditic xenotype with ravishing beauty, enhanced productivity, and extended lifespans. Their enfeebled skeletal and immune systems belie a natural affinity for cultivation: their psycho-transhumanist alternative to psycasting, which they abhor due to its archotech association.\n\nOriginating from Caoâ€™s Wisdom, a former glitterworld, the yaoma were designed by the first of them: their mythologized hero-king Ku. Generations since have accrued an outsized influence on humanity despite their minority status, and are commonly found within enclaves on mid- to glitterworlds. These communities, in the name of their Jade Progenitor, abide by his/her tenets of humanity, resilience, and wisdom; these primary beliefs are why practically all yaoma practice cultivation.</description>
